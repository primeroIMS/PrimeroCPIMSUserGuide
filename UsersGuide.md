# Introduction

![](img/intro1.png)  
The _Information Management and Innovation to Protect Children in Emergencies_ project has developed a  
software application that will help partners securely collect, store,  
manage, and share data for protection-related incident monitoring and  
case management. The new platform is called _Primero_  
\(Protection-related Information Management\).  
_Primero_ supports multiple modules, including the “next generation” of the field-tested,  
inter-agency CPIMS and GBVIMS systems, which are currently in  
use in 20+ countries. These new iterations, called the CPIMS+ and  
GBVIMS+, along with the newly developed MRMIMS+, can operate  
separately or be deployed as integrated modules on the _Primero_  
platform. The inter-agency Steering Committees that govern the use of  
each of these modules will continue to support the new system.

![](img/intro2.png)_Primero_ is flexible and adaptable to  
accommodate a broad range of protection concerns including GBV,  
unaccompanied and separated children, and monitoring grave violations  
of children’s rights in situations of armed conflict. To meet  
operational challenges, the application was designed to function both  
on- and off-line, with limited or no connectivity, and in multiple  
deployment configurations. A strong emphasis has been placed on  
security and confidentiality, with intuitive workflows designed to  
simplify processes while promoting good practice. Role-based access  
and granular security ensures that only those who need to see data  
will have access to it. All system transactions are time stamped,  
password protected and encrypted. _Primero_ has a user-friendly  
interface and intuitive tools, facilitating the work of field  
personnel while decreasing security risks and duplication. The  
application can leverage mobile data gathering tools such as RapidFTR  
on smart phones and tablets. In order to optimize results, _Primero_  
was designed to be able to exchange data internally between modules,  
as well as externally with other IM systems. In addition to imports  
and exports, Primero has a highly secure application program interface  
\(JSON API\).

_Primero_ functions as a distributed database, meaning that  
implementing partners can retain ownership of data while contributing  
and sharing information on shared programmes. In child protection  
interventions, referrals and case transfers are critical to effective  
service provision. Sharing sensitive information is a part of good  
programming. Data exchanges between organizations should be governed  
by endorsed information sharing protocols adapted to local contexts.  
_Primero_ design is based on the “need to know” principle; it does not  
impose data sharing, but facilitates the process when consent is  
provided, and when it is deemed appropriate and safe by partners.

![](img/intro44.png)Good information management practice  
emphasizes the importance of making data actionable. _Primero_ has  
built-in customizable reports that can facilitate periodic reporting  
processes, and be used to analyze data for programmatic insights. A  
document and photo repository allows end users to organize relevant  
resources in one convenient place

>  _A note for end users. Although there are a standard set of forms configured
>  in the CPIMS+ based on the CPWG standard forms that we recommend using, your
>  System Administrator may have configured these forms specific to your location  
>  and needs. For any questions about the forms and information you have or need,  
>  please reach out to this person_

## Logging In

When logging into Primero, you’ll see Username and Password boxes.
Click in the Username box and type in your unique user name provided
to you by your System Administrator. Then enter your password in the
field below and click on 'LOG IN'.

# Navigating Primero

## Header Navigation Bar

The header navigation is the dark bar across the top of the screen in  
which you navigate to your home page \(or dashboard\), Cases, Tracing  
Requests, Reports, and bulk export downloads. It also has a quick
search field that can help you find a specific case quickly. Your current
page will be highlighted. See below:

![](/img/image71.png)

## Dashboard

The Dashboard, or Home Page, is where you can quickly find information
for your cases. Depending on the work you do in your organization,
it contains a number of different types of information, which can include
caseload summaries, recently flagged cases, cases for which approval has
been requested or cases that are pending approval, referred cases, etc. The
case worker dashboard will be different, from the managers and from the
administrator.


### Case Dashboards

If your user has access to cases through either the CP or GBV module,  
you will see one--and only one--of the following three case dashboards.

#### Cases Dashboard

The first example below is the basic Cases Dashboard. If you have any  
access to cases, but you are not a manager or an administrator, you will  
see this dashboard. Here, three sections appear. The first lists your  
total cases, as well as the number of _new_ cases. \(In this case, “new”  
means anything which has not been edited since its creation.\) The second  
lists out cases by high, medium, and low assessment levels, and, once  
again, dividing these between total and “new.” The final section gives  
the total number of referrals along with new referrals.

![](img/image72.png)

Based on possible actions in the system, the cases dashboard may have a
different appearance, see below for a screenshot. In this case, the first
section tells you three things: the number of total cases and new cases
you have; the number of transfers you have been made that are pending or
rejected; and the number of transfers you have that are waiting for your
approval or rejection. The next section shows your cases with pending,
rejected, or approved BIA, Care Plan, and Closure forms. The final section
gives the total number of referrals, as well as new referrals.

![](/img/image74.png)

#### Manager Dashboard

The Manager Dashboard, meanwhile, appears if you have managerial tasks in
your organization. This dashboard does basically the same thing that the
Cases Dashboard does, but also sees the cases of the team you manage. The
first section tells the number of total and new cases you have. The next
section lists the total and new cases that each team member has. Below
that is a list of the total and new referrals for each of your managed
users. The final section breaks down the number of cases you have by
assessment level. As mentioned before, if you see the Manager Dashboard,
you will not see the standard Cases Dashboard. A single user can only have
one of the case dashboards display on their Dashboard Page.

![](img/image73.png)

Once again, flagged cases will be on the right hand side of the screen  
if you have the Manager Dashboard. However, this time, there will be  
only one list of flagged cases, and the cases there will all be flagged  
by you. This is because managers often do not have their own cases and  
will thus only be concerned with cases which they themselves have  
flagged, and which belong to one of their team members.

Alternatively, the manager dashboard can have also have a different
appearance based on the possible actions in the system. The first section
tells the number of total and new cases you have, as well as the number
of cases that have been transferred to you and are waiting for approval
or rejection. The next section lists the total and new cases that each of
your managed users has. The next section shows you cases with BIA, Care
Plan, or Closure forms you have approved or are waiting for your approval.
Below that is a list of the total and new referrals for each of your
managed. 

![](/img/image75.png)

#### Admin Dashboard

Finally, you will see the Admin Dashboard upon login if your user’s role  
has access to all records in the system \(thus giving you an  
administrator’s functionality\). On this dashboard, you will see is a  
table of cases by district, with each row broken down into total open  
cases, cases created last week, cases created this week, cases closed  
last week, and cases closed this week. \(Here, a week is measured from  
midnight Monday morning to 11:59 Sunday night. This means that for a  
case to have been created this week, it must have been created during or  
since the immediately preceding Monday morning.\) As stated previously,  
if you see the Admin Dashboard, you will not see the Cases Dashboard or  
the Manager Dashboard, since one user can only have one of the case  
dashboards display on their Dashboard Page.

Flags are, once again, on the right. Like the Manager Dashboard, and for  
similar reasons, the Admin Dashboard only lists those cases which you  
have flagged.

![](img/image58.png)

### Flagged Case Lists

If you see any of the case dashboards, the right of your screen will
show one or two lists of flagged cases. These lists will keep you  
reminded of pending flags. The first list, shown above, consists of
the cases which you have flagged most recently. The second list, shown
below, is a list of your cases which someone else has flagged, and only
displays for the Casesand Admin Dashboards. \(Since managers often do not
even have the ability to make cases, it makes no sense for them to have a
list of flagged cases which they own.\)

![](img/image22.png)

### GBV Incident Dashboard

The GBV Incident Dashboard will appear below whichever case dashboard  
you have if your user’s role has access to incidents through the GBV  
module. The table in this dashboard lists out each incident, with  
columns for “Incident \#ID,” “Date of Interview,” “Date of Incident,”  
and “Violence Type.” Each incident’s id will link to the incident’s  
page, and each incident will feature an icon indicating the number of  
flags it has, provided it has at least one. To the right of the GBV  
Incident Dashboard will be a list of incidents flagged by the user.

![](img/image48.png)

## List View

When selecting the record type or page you want to visit via the header  
navigation, you can see all cases or tracing requests that belong to you  
when you click on CASES. Once there, you see a list of the possible  
matching records, that you are able to filter and/or sort. See below:

![](img/image53.png)

## Edit and View a record

When creating a new record, you automatically are brought to the “Edit”  
page for that record. You can enter in all the relevant information you  
need at this time and save when done.

When selecting an existing record, you are brought to “View” the record.  
This means you can view all the data and forms you have permission to,  
but cannot edit. You must click the Edit button in the Action Buttons  
section of the header to change any information that is currently  
represented.

## Action Buttons

Our Action Buttons are the buttons just below our Header Navigation,  
which allow a user to act on a case or cases. The actions, depending on  
your permissions, are:

* Flagging

* Export

* Custom Exports

* Import \(List View\)

* Transfer

* Refer

* Assign

* Disable

* Save \(edit view only\)

* Cancel \(edit view only\)

* Mark for mobile

* Un-mark for mobile

* Request Approvals

* Approvals

Please note that when using these actions you must work according to the CP
SoPs that are in place. Also, the system does not replace the communication
that you need to have in a child protection case management program, through
case conferences, emails or other to ensure that people are aware of
transfers and referrals and to follow up on referred and transferred cases. 

![](img/image67.png)

This bar, along with the Header Navigation bar, are part of what is  
called the **Anchored Header**, meaning, they never leave the screen  
when scrolling. This allows a user to easily navigate or act on a case  
or number of cases at any time.

## My Account and Contact & Help links

Above the Header Navigation bar, there are small links that bring you to  
pages that help you manage your account and contact information, as well  
as find out who is your site administrator. Clicking on the Primero icon
from any page will take you back to the dashboard from anywhere.

# Filtering

Filtering your Case List or search results is an efficient way to narrow  
down to the case or cases that need your immediate attention. You can  
filter the list to show not only if a case has other characteristics but  
contains specific information within those characteristics as well. For  
example, you can filter by males only, but you can also filter by  
specific Protection Concern, Current Location, and the case registration  
date range.

The Filter panel is on visible on search results page or when you click  
**CASES** tab in the header. See below:

![](img/image63.png)

In the image, there is the normal checkbox filter selection, in which  
you click using your mouse, but also date range and drop down fields.  
For Date Ranges, you can enter these using any of the date field type  
actions. You can set the range for one day as well. For the drop down  
field, this is clickable with the mouse and you can only select one  
value.

# Flagging

Flagging a case is a way to alert either yourself or a manager that a
case needs additional work or attention. To flag a case:

 1. Once you have opened the case, click on Flags
 2. Enter the flag reason and if applicable the Date by which this flag
    needs to be addressed
 3. Click flags to complete

Note that only the person who flagged the case can unflag the case. To
do so:

 1. Click on the (+) button next to the flag, under the Unflag Case heading.
 2. Enter a reason for unflagging the case.

A history of the flags and unflags for the case is stored. To see the history,
click on the View History tab, you can view the details of the flags and
unflags.

![](/img/image76.png)

# Assign Users

Managers have ability to assign a case to a different user. If you select the
Assign option from the Actions dropdown menu, a modal will appear that allows
you to select from existing users. Assigning the case will change the record
owner to the selected user, that record will no longer be available to the
previous case worker.

![](/img/image77.png)

# Reopen

Users have the ability to reopen closed cases. Reopen displays in the Action
menu on the case view page below Disable; it does not display on the case list
view . Clicking Reopen brings up a confirmation dialog saying that clicking ok
will change the status of the case to open. When the user clicks OK, the “Case
Reopened?” field in the Basic Identity form is checked, the case status is set
to Open, and the case’s state is set to Valid. This also creates an entry on the
Record Information form.

![](/img/image78.png)

# Approvals

## Caseworker

Case worker roles have the ability to request approval for the Care Plan from the
manager. This is done by selecting the request approval option under the actions
dropdown. This will produce a modal to submit the request. Once the approval
request is made, it will show up as pending under the approvals section on the
caseworker dashboard. It will also appear on the manager’s dashboard as a pending
approval. Once the manager approves or rejects the form for the case, the status
will change on both the case worker and manager dashboards.

![](/img/image79.png)

# Search and Advanced Search

## Quick Search

Quick Search refers to the search field in the header navigation bar.  
From here you can type in your search and return a list of possible  
matches. If you are searching from the cases page you can enter your  
case’s value for one of the following fields to find a match: “Long ID,”  
“Case ID,” “proGres ID,” “Name,” “Nickname,” “Other Name,” “Ration Card Number,” “ICRC  
Ref No.,” “RC ID No.,” “UNHCR ID,” “UN Number,” and “Other Agency ID.”  
When looking for a tracing request, you can search these fields: “Long  
ID,” “Inquirer ID,” “Name of inquirer,” and “Nickname of inquirer.”  
After searching, you can filter results further.

# Exporting Information on Records

Exporting individual cases or a list of cases can be useful in a number  
of ways. This action can be found in the **ACTIONS** header button which  
will display a drop down to select what format you want to export - PDF,  
XLS, CSV, etc.

| **Format** | **Description** | **Fields Included** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSV | Stands for “Comma-Separated Values.” Readable in excel, and can be imported back into any Primero instance. | All fields to which the user’s role has access. |
| Excel | Exports to a standard .xls file, which can be re-imported back into Primero. | All fields to which the user’s role has access. |
| JSON | Easiest format to be read \(only\) by Primero, and the preferred format for importing. | All fields to which the user’s role has access. |
| Photo Wall | Exports a PDF file with the photo of each selected case along with the case’s ID. Cannot be re-imported into Primero. | Photo, ID. |
| PDF | PDF file containing a profile on each case, including the fields from the forms specified by the user. Cannot be imported. | All fields specified by the user, to which the user’s role has access. |
| UNHCR | CSV file specifically formatted to be compatible with UNHCR’s data import. | All fields to which the user’s role has access. |
| Custom | Excel file containing all the fields specified by the user. Can be imported back into Primero. | All fields specified by the user, to which the user’s role has access. |

![](img/image57.png)

Once you’ve selected your format, the export window will appear, allowing
you to set your own password for the file, and create your own file name.

![](img/image52.png)

To export a list of cases, while in the case list view, you can select  
as many as you’d like to export via the check boxes:

![](img/image60.png)

To export all cases, you can leave all unchecked and it will export all  
cases you have access to. The bulk export will generate in the background.
You can continue to use the app while it is generating. To access it,
click on the tab with the download icon. 

![](/img/image80.png)

To export a single case, you can either check only that case in the case  
list, or enter into the case to view it, then use the ACTIONS button to  
export.

# Creating a New Case

When creating a new case, the process is fairly simple. In the Actions  
Buttons area of the header there is a “New Case” button that will open  
up the forms to enter information. See the “New Case”button below:

![](img/image69.png)

Once in the forms, you can navigate to different forms as we describe in  
the “Navigating Primero Forms”section

# Navigating Primero Forms

Once you are creating or editing a form, you will see a navigation list  
in the left panel. This list is an organized way to navigate through  
your forms. The initial titles you see are called **Form Groups** and  
are set up by your site administrator. The current form you are on will  
be highlighted - see below:

![](img/image44.png)

If a Form Group has only one form, you can simply click on it and it  
will populate the form. If it has more than one, you can click on the  
Form Group name or the expand icon to the right of the name to expand it  
and see all the forms in the group. Once expanded you can then click on  
any of the form names to enter into the chosen form. For example, in the  
image above, the user has selected the “Assessment” form group and the  
“Care Assessments” form.

### Navigating Sub-Forms

In certain data sets and forms, we find that information pertaining to  
an event or entity is nearly identical. For example, information on  
specific family members can be the same form, just labeled per family  
member name and relationship. So in cases like this, we’ve designed  
these forms as “sub-forms,” and you manually add additional individual  
forms to add information on family members, individual follow ups, etc.  
To navigate those, there is an expand/collapse function, and an  
add/remove function.

# Creating, Updating, or Editing a Case

Once you’ve entered into the case you would like to update, you must  
click the **EDIT** button in the actions header. The page will then  
refresh and allow you edit individual form fields.

There are a number of different field types in which you can edit  
differently.

* **Text** - Type normally using your keypad or keyboard.

* **Text Area** - Similar to the Text field. Type normally, the field expands for more information as you continue to enter information.

* **Date** - Multiple ways to edit

  * You can type in a numerical date in the format of dd-mm-yyyy

  * You can type in the first three letters of the month in the format of 01-Jan-2014

  * You can use the calendar widget to go to the correct day and select it directly

* **Check Boxes** - You may click one or many of the options using the mouse.

* **Tick Box** - You may click on the box using the mouse.

* **Select Drop Down** - Click any option to select it.**Multi-Select Drop Down** - Begin typing and either hit ‘enter’ or click to select multiple options.

* **Radio Button** - Similar to Tick Box, click on the correct answer using the mouse

* **Numeric Field** - Key the number into the field.

* **Tally Field** - Key in the number you need for each tally. The total automatically calculates based on the tally fields and is not editable in itself.

When you attempt to save, there is always the possibility that one or  
more of the fields you entered will be formatted incorrectly. For  
instance, if you try to fill in the “Date of Birth” field--which is  
supposed to be a format-specific date--with the words, “a pretty long  
time ago,” Primero will be unable to save the information. In that case,  
after you hit the “save” button, the case will fail to update with your  
new information, and the “Date of Birth” field’s label will be  
highlighted in red, to inform you that the field has been entered  
incorrectly.

# Generating Automatic Follow Ups

While you are making changes to a case, you can make your job managing  
the case easier by having Primero generate reminders to perform a follow  
up every two weeks. To do this, click on the “Protection Concerns” Form  
Section, under the “Identification / Registration” Form Group and check  
the “Generate follow up reminders?” tick box. If you click save, Primero  
will automatically create a flag \(to be discussed later\) on the case for  
you, once every two weeks, which will remind you to perform a follow up. This feature may or may not be turned on.

# Transfers and Referrals

## Transfers

Transferring a record is a basic form of reassignment. There are some  
processes surrounding this for a transfer to a non-Primero individual or  
a Primero user outside your instance. But those will be determined by  
your organization and the sharing protocol of the organization of the  
person you are transferring to.

To transfer a record from either the individual record page or the list  
view, use the ACTIONS button in the Action Header to initiate the drop  
down of options. Within the options, select “Transfer Case.”

![](img/image21.png)

The following modal form will appear and allow you to select options for  
your transfer. Consent of the individual \(or a consent override\) is  
generally needed for transfers, although not for those which take place  
within the same Primero instance.

![](img/image46.png)

If you are transferring within your Primero instance, select the  
“Existing User”--a user within your deployment of Primero. If the  
desired user is not in the drop down, it means this user does not have  
privileges to be transferred to.

If you are not transferring within the Primero instance, check the “Are  
you transferring to a remote system?” tickbox, and more options will  
appear for this “remote” transfer. A remote transfer creates a transfer  
export that is password protected to be shared outside the system.

![](img/image43.png)

If you are transferring to a user outside your system who is using  
another Primero instance, you simply select “Primero” in the drop down  
marked “What type of export do you want.” In this case, the file Primero  
exports will be a JSON file which can be imported into the remote  
Primero system.

> _Note:  
> When transferring any such password-protected export/import file, the  
> means of sending the file, filename, and the password that opens it,  
> will be determined by the Information Sharing Protocol \(ISP\) decided  
> by the appropriate local steering committee. When determining this  
> policy, on-the-ground security considerations will be at play, as well  
> as the ease and speed of physical transport within the country._

## Referrals

Referring a record is a way of giving a user limited access to a record  
without transferring it completely. As with transfers, there are some  
processes surrounding this action when referring to a non-Primero  
individual or a user outside your instance. These processes, however,  
will be determined by your organization and the sharing protocol of the  
organization of the person you are referring to.

To refer a record from either the individual record page or the list  
view, use the ACTIONS button in the Action Header to initiate the drop  
down of options. Within the options, select “Refer Case.”

![](img/image56.png)

The following modal form will appear and allow you to select options for  
your referral. As with transfers, consent \(or a consent override\) of the  
individual is generally required for a referral.

![](img/image50.png)

If you are making a referral within your Primero instance, select the  
“Existing User”--a user within your deployment of Primero. If the  
desired user is not in the drop down, it means this user does not have  
privileges to be referred to. You must also select the type of service  
that will be rendered by the user to whom you are referring.

If you are not making a referral within the Primero instance, check the  
“Are you referring to a remote system?” tickbox, and more options will  
appear for this “remote” referral. A remote referral creates a referral  
export that is password protected to be shared outside the system.

![](img/image68.png)

If you are making a referral to a user outside your system who is using  
another Primero instance, you simply select “Primero” in the drop down  
marked “What type of export do you want.” In this case, the file Primero  
exports will be a JSON file which can be imported into the remote  
Primero system.

# Reports

Reports allow users to see a high-level, aggregate view of data, helping  
them to understand trends and coming challenges in their work. Only  
certain roles--and thus certain users--will have the ability to create  
or view reports. Some users will be able to navigate to the **Reports**  
section of the application and view existing reports but not edit them  
or create new ones, while others will have the ability to view, create,  
edit, and export reports.

## Creating a Report

To create a report, first click the **Reports** link in the top toolbar.  
You will see that there are already a number of pre-built reports which  
you can view at any time. To start your own, click the **Create Report**  
button at the top of the screen.

![](img/image23.png)

When you have reached the new report form, be sure to enter a name and  
description for your report. You must then specify the module from which  
to draw the records for your report, as well as the type of records you  
want to be drawing upon. Here, we have chosen the Child Protection  
module, and the Case record type.

![](img/image54.png)

Next comes choosing the row and column attributes by which you want your  
data to be grouped. The first item you choose in each field will be the  
outer grouping layer, with each successive item acting as a  
sub-categorization. Taking a look at the example below, we can see that  
the columns of our report have been first divided by sex, and then  
sub-divided by permanent district/chiefdom, since these are the first  
and second “Group by column” attributes, respectively. We can see that  
the rows of the report follow the same pattern.

![](img/image59.png)

![](img/image65.png)

![](img/image51.png)

The columns of your report will be augmented by a final “Total” column,  
which shows the aggregate for each row. It is important to note that the  
numbers in each of your columns may not add up to the number in your  
total column, since many attributes will go undefined by the workers  
doing registration. For instance, in the example below, three cases with  
the “child has been abandoned” protection concern were never assigned a  
sex, resulting in a report with one female, no males, and four total  
cases.

![](img/image24.png)

Furthermore, any reports based on fields within certain nested forms  
will automatically count a field for each saved record, even if a nested  
form for this field was never filled out. This is because Primero  
automatically populates an empty subform on the page for form sections  
such as “Protection Concerns,” so that the user can easily enter  
information. When a user fails to enter information for that field,  
however, the field still counts as a single item. For instance, if you  
were to create a case and fail to enter any information into the blank  
Protection Concerns subform, a report outlining how many cases had each  
type of protection concern would still count your case as having a  
single protection concern type, even though you had never entered any  
information on the Protection Concerns subform. This would then count  
into the total, without counting into the column for any single one of  
the protection concern types. Taking a look at the example below, we can  
see that, in the Freetown district, one child has been registered as  
abandoned and one with a protection concern type of “Extreme levels of  
poverty.” But the total number of protection concerns for this district  
is three, meaning that one case was registered with a protection concern  
form where the protection concern type was never filled in.

![](img/image61.png)

After you have defined the row and column attributes for your report,  
you will choose the fields from which you will receive an aggregate  
count. This feature obviously only works on numeric fields. To give an  
example of how it works, imagine we have a report that disaggregates  
your cases based on number of children in the family and date of birth  
\(by year\). Three cases end up going into the report: one born in 2004  
whose family has three children, one born in 2001 whose family has six  
children, and another born in 2001 whose family also has six children.  
Here is what the report would normally look like:

![](img/image49.png)

As you can see, the 2001 column has the number “2” in the “7” row, since  
there are two cases born in 2001 whose families have seven children. We  
see this same number in the “Total” column for the “7” row for the same  
reasons. If we choose to have aggregate counts on the “Number of  
children” field, however, the report would look like this:

Now, instead of seeing that there are two cases that meet the criteria  
for being born in 2001 and having a family with seven children, we  
instead see the number “14,” representative of fourteen total children.  
Once again, this field also shows up in the “Total” column.

### Age Range

The next field, specifying age range, helps make reports involving age  
more manageable by grouping them into a smaller list of ranges. The two  
images below exemplify the usefulness of this feature. The first shows  
part of a sprawling report without age ranges enabled. The second shows  
the same report with age ranges.

### Date Ranges

The next field, “Use date ranges,” allows you to do much the same thing,  
but with date fields instead of ages. Now, instead of having to have a  
column for every date over a two year period--as would be the case with  
the default, day-long range--you can disaggregate your records by  
whether or not they fit into week-, month-, or year-long spans of time.

### Filters

Next, you can put filters on the records you are using to eliminate  
irrelevant data. By default, each report filters to include only those  
records with a “Case Status” of “Open” and a “Valid Record?” value of  
“Yes.” You can create a filter on any single-select, multi-select, tick  
box, check box, radio button, number, tally, or date field, and for each  
one, you can specify which values are acceptable for records being  
included into the report.

Finally, you are asked whether you would like to generate an exportable  
graph of your report.

## Viewing your reports

If you click save on your report, and it saves successfully, you should  
arrive at the view page for your report. You will first see a table  
representing your report. Above the table, you should see either one or  
two tabs. The first, marked “Table,” represents what you currently see.  
The second, which will only appear if you specified that your report  
should generate a graph, will be marked “Graph” and will show you just  
that.

You can also use the **Export** button above the tabs to export either  
the data \(in CSV form\) or the graph \(as a .png image file\). Below is an  
example of a graph generated and then exported from a report.
